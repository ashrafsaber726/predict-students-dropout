üéØ Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Machine Learning classification project aimed at predicting student dropout and academic success in higher education. The core objective is to build a robust predictive model that identifies at-risk students early, allowing educational institutions to implement timely support systems and improve overall retention rates. The analysis explores a dataset of 37 features, revealing that demographic and academic factors, such as marital status and daytime/evening attendance, are key predictors of success or struggle. The best-performing model, Random Forest Classifier, achieved a reliable accuracy of 87.75%.





üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies
The project utilizes Python and a wide array of machine learning tools to handle complex classification and preprocessing tasks:

Tool/Library	Primary Role
Python	Core language for the entire data science workflow.
Pandas / NumPy	
Data manipulation, transformation, and handling 37 distinct features.


Scikit-learn	
Implementation of various Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest) and Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).


XGBoost / Keras (TensorFlow)	
Advanced model implementation for boosted tree classification and neural networks.


Preprocessing		
SMOTE for handling data imbalance, feature engineering, scaling (Standard/Robust), and categorical encoding.



Visualization	
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for EDA and presenting results.
